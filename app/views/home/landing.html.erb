                  	<i>Spit, Chew, Swallow</i> rating system. Inspired by the Facebook Like button, the <i>Spit, Chew, Swallow</i> buttons would replace the five-star rating system that is currently present on Gumroad's show page for musicians and artists within the <i>Recorded Music</i> product category. The <i>Spit, Chew, Swallow</i> buttons are tied to a weighted points scale (akin to credit card rewards systems) that allows for musicians and artists to better benefit from their talent, work and/or popularity in a way that is deemed fair for users with Gumroad and random selected musicians and artists (think jury duty) serving as the official "oversight" for fairness.
